# Local Models with llama.cpp

AkramCode supports the [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) router server. The router discovers multiple GGUF models and loads or unloads them on demand.

Use a current llama.cpp build with router support. Follow the [build instructions](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/docs/build.md) or install a [prebuilt release](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases) for your platform.

## Start the router

Start `llama-server` without `--model` or `-m`. Passing a model starts single-model mode instead of router mode.

```bash
llama-server \
  --models-dir ~/models \
  --no-models-autoload \
  --jinja \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  -ngl 999 \
  -c 32768
```

Important options:

- `--models-dir ~/models` discovers local GGUF files.
- `--no-models-autoload` keeps loading explicit: load models on the router before selecting them.
- `--jinja` enables compatible chat templates and tool calling.
- `-ngl 999` offloads as many layers as possible to the GPU.
- `-c 32768` sets the context window for each loaded model. Omit it to use the model's native context, which may require substantially more memory.

A single-file model can sit directly in the model directory. Put multimodal and multi-shard models in separate subdirectories:

```text
~/models/
├── llama-3.2-1b-Q4_K_M.gguf
├── gemma-3-4b-it-Q4_K_M/
│   ├── gemma-3-4b-it-Q4_K_M.gguf
│   └── mmproj-F16.gguf
└── large-model-Q4_K_M/
    ├── large-model-Q4_K_M-00001-of-00003.gguf
    ├── large-model-Q4_K_M-00002-of-00003.gguf
    └── large-model-Q4_K_M-00003-of-00003.gguf
```

Restart the router after manually adding files. For per-model context sizes and other options, use [llama.cpp model presets](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md#model-presets).

## Configure AkramCode

Start AkramCode and configure the provider:

```text
/login llama.cpp
```

Enter the router URL and optional API key. Press Enter on an empty URL to use `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. AkramCode selects the first loaded model; use `/model` to pick another.

If you start the router with `--no-models-autoload` and no model is loaded yet, `/login llama.cpp` only stores the connection. Load a model on the router, then select it with `/model`.

If the server uses an API key, start `llama-server` with the matching `--api-key` value. Keep `--host 127.0.0.1` for local-only access.

## Manage models

Load and unload models on the router itself, for example through its API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/models/load -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"model":"<id>"}'
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/models/unload -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"model":"<id>"}'
```

Loaded and sleeping models appear in `/model`. Sleeping models wake automatically when selected. With router autoload enabled, unloaded preset models also appear and load when selected.

## Classification

Every model listed for chat is also listed as a classifier model with the same ID and the `llama-cpp-classify` API. Classifier models answer typed `choice`, `bool`, and `score` questions about JSON state, like TypeSafe's Jev models. The model reaches them from [`codemode`](cli.md#enable-codemode) scripts, and extensions through `ctx.modelRegistry.classify()`; see [Classifier models](models.md#use-classifier-models).

The model does not generate an answer. Each question becomes one chat prompt: the state, every question of the request, the state again, and then the question with its answers under single-token labels. Labels are letters for a choice (up to 62 options), `Yes`/`No` for a bool, and digits for a score (up to 10 levels). The second copy of the state is read with the questions in view, which improved accuracy on JevBench with small models. AkramCode reads the probabilities of the labels as the next token and normalizes them. A choice returns every option's probability and a confidence of `(n * peak - 1) / (n - 1)`; a score returns the expected level.

- Raw label probabilities are usually overconfident. The per-request `temperature` option divides the label logits before normalizing; values above 1 soften the distribution. It changes no answer.
- Questions run one after another. Everything before the final question is the same for all questions of a request, so the server's prompt cache evaluates it once. The state appears twice, so it needs twice its size in context.
- Small models may follow instructions written inside the state. The prompt tells the model to judge the state as data, but that is not a guarantee.
- Hybrid models such as Qwen3.5 cannot rewind a partially cached prompt without context checkpoints. If each question reprocesses the whole state, start the router with `--ctx-checkpoints 32 --checkpoint-min-step 0`.

## Troubleshooting

Check that the router is reachable:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/models
```

- **No models on the router:** Check `--models-dir`, the directory layout, and restart the router.
- **Model missing from `/model` with `--no-models-autoload`:** Load it on the router first.
- **Load fails or uses too much memory:** Lower `-c` or unload another model.
- **Server is not in router mode:** Start it without `--model`, `-m`, or `-hf`.

To remove the `llama.cpp` provider, disable `llama.cpp` under Built-in in `akramcode config`, or set `"extensions": ["-builtin:llama.cpp"]` in [settings](settings.md#resources).
